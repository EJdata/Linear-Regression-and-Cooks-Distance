# Linear-Regression-and-Cooks-Distance
An individual project for Linear Regression analysis

This is an individual project exploring linear regression analysis and the use of cooks distance to locate and remove outlier data to better the fit of the linear regression model.  

The dataset is the Fuel dataset, publicly available in R

The linear regression model predicts carbon emission based on vehicle features, such as city_mpg
